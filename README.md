Coffee Shop Checklist for MAP2 GUI

Red = New additional Requirements/Functionality building on MAP1
•	Display a welcome message to the user, giving the name of your coffee shop and logo
•	Ask the user for their personal details for delivery
•	Display a menu of products to the user. The menu needs to include the product code eg coff for coffee the product description and unit price as a minimum
•	Capture the users order by allowing the user to enter the product code eg coff, the system should then automatically store the product description and unit price
•	Prompt the user for the product quantity 
•	Calculate the total cost of the order 
•	Ask the user how much they would like to pay
•	Calculate their change 
•	Present the user with a receipt of their order
•	To achieve higher marks, you need to allow the user to customise their drink for example when choosing hot chocolate, they have the option to add whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles and add marshmallows. This needs to be displayed on the receipt and increase the total cost based on the additional extras chosen.
•	The system needs to be robust and be able to handle erroneous/invalid data. Integrate validation into the system to handle the following:
o	A Presence Check (no blank data eg first name cannot be blank/null)
o	A Range Check (a value must be entered between an upper a lower limit e.g. quantity between 1 and 10)
o	A lookup/list check (a user can only enter from a list of acceptable values e.g. customer title Mr, Ms, Miss, Dr or a Menu Code from the list presented only)
o	A Length check (A customer first name cannot exceed 20 characters)
